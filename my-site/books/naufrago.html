                    The full title of this book is <blockquote>Relato de un náufrago que estuvo diez días a la deriva en una balsa sin comer ni beber, que fue proclamado héroe de la patria, besado por las reinas de la belleza y hecho rico por la publicidad, y luego aborrecido por el gobierno y olvidado para siempre.</blockquote>
                    that is <i>Story of a castaway that stayed ten days adrift in a raft without eating nor drinking, that was proclaimed national hero, kissed by beauty queens and made rich by publicity, and then dispised by the government and forgotten forever.</i>

                    With this book, Gabriel García Márquez discovered himself as a narrator. However, its main intention was to write a report about a man, Luis Alejandro Velasco, that stayed ten days adrift in a raft swayed by the Caribean sea. The future Literature Nobel prize winner and then young reporter that was García Márquez

                    <b><i class="yellow">Chapter 1</i></b>. An admirable hability of García Márquez is how he can begin a book by 'spoiling' the ending —it literally being described in the title— and still make it a captivating story. Like in his <i>Crónica de una muerte anunciada</i>, he manages to be constantly refering to the tragic destiny of its characters in a way that still makes the reader wonder what will happen next. In particular, I admire how he can weave in premonitions and signs of what's to come without it sounding trivial or silly. He referts to death in a simple yet grave manner, which only increases the horror as pages go by while knowing the ending.

                    This quote is such a perfect example of this: it plays on what we know will happen without vanalizing it, the premonition serving solely as a dagger, sinking every time we're reminded where the story is headed.

                    <b><i class="yellow">Chapter 3</i></b>. The accident has a clean retelling. Simple. There's no storm, there's only mild confussion, not enough to sell onto the idea that something bad is about to happen. Only in a matter of lines —in a matter of minutes— four men die at sea. They simply sink, disappear, to never be seen again. It's as chilling as it's plain.

                    <b><i class="yellow">Chapter 10</i></b>. A silly observation but: we know by the title that our protagonist won't be saved until the 10th day. Yet, the way the story progresses makes us believe at times that, maybe, he will be saved before that. That is, until the 9th day, where we are led to almost lose hope.

                    <p>The book's description if this death wish is like not our ordinary one: it's not carried over by clinical depression but by rationality, almost. The knowledge that it's most unlikely and improbable that one will be saved.</p>
